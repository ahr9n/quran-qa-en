1. In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful.
2. Have you considered him who denies the religion?
3. It is he who mistreats the orphan.
4. And does not encourage the feeding of the poor.
5. So woe to those who pray.
6. Those who are heedless of their prayers.
7. Those who put on the appearance.
8. And withhold the assistance.
