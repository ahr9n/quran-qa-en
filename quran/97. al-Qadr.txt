1. In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful.
2. We sent it down on the Night of Decree.
3. But what will convey to you what the Night of Decree is?
4. The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months.
5. In it descend the angels and the Spirit, by the leave of their Lord, with every command.
6. Peace it is; until the rise of dawn.
