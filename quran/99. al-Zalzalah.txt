1. In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful.
2. When the earth is shaken with its quake.
3. And the earth brings out its loads.
4. And man says, "What is the matter with it?"
5. On that Day, it will tell its tales.
6. For your Lord will have inspired it.
7. On that Day, the people will emerge in droves, to be shown their works.
8. Whoever has done an atom's weight of good will see it.
9. And whoever has done an atom's weight of evil will see it.
